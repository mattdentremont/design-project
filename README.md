Term 5 Junior Design Project w/ Luke Kelly
A dungeon crawler game where you encounter nightmares of computer engineering.

Included with the package is a .jar file. Running this should run the game.
If this does not work for some reason, a tried and true method that works for us is just to import the project into intelliJIDEA (other IDEs may work), and run the DeskTopLauncher.java file.
Also submitted is a .zip folder. This is the project folder. Extract this folder to see the code within.
The code that we wrote is contained in libGDX\core\src\com\game.

The game requires a keyboard with qwerty keys and arrow keys.
On the main menu, select items with the arrow keys and select them with enter.

When playing:
Move with WASD - attack with arrow keys.
Pause the game with ESC.
Items are used with Q and E.
Ultimate ability is used with F.

Other screens:
Controls to navigate to menus/resume game e.t.c will be shown to you on screen.

The map is currently set to be 5x5, but it would usually be set to be larger.(Set small for demo)
The bosses are not very difficult in their current state, but are easily made harder. (Set relatively easy for demo)
You should encounter 2 boss rooms out of the 25 total rooms.
THe room with the red background's left door is located in the top left of the screen, it is a trap door and might be hard to find in the beginning.

If you clear all rooms (25) the game will present you with a screen telling you that you won.
Highscores are saved to a file on your machine once you run the code called "GameStorage". On windows it will be here: "%UserProfile%/.prefs/My Preferences", and on Linux it will be here: "~/.prefs/My Preferences".

Selecting high score from the main menu will display statistics from your game where you got your highest score.

Have fun playing the game!
